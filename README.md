# Othello-AI
I made an Alpha-Beta and Monte Carlo (MCTS) implementation for the game of Othello. Got 4th place (tied) for the first round, and a runner up for the 2nd round using my MCTS implementation for this competition: https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu//~csc384h/summer/othello_results.html (name is kammulaa).
