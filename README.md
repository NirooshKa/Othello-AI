# Othello-AI
I made the following types of AI to play the game of Othello:
(1) Alpha-Beta 
(2) Enhanced Heuristic & UCB Monte Carlo AI (MCTS) 

**Both the Alpha-Beta and Enhanced MCTS use a similar heuristic.**

I Got 4th place (tied) for the first round, and a runner up for the 2nd round using my MCTS implementation for this competition: https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu//~csc384h/summer/othello_results.html (name is kammulaa). 

First round rankings: https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu//~csc384h/summer/Othello/FirstRound.pdf (name is kammulaa).

To test this code, using this link: https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu//~csc384h/summer/Assignments/A3/, download code.zip, and replace agent.py with the agent.py in this repository, or agent_mcts.py. The code.zip allows for 2 AI's to play against each other.
